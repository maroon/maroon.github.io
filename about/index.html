<p>My name is Ryan and I like programming. It’s more likely an obsession if we’re being honest. You see, when people ask me what I do for a living I tell them that I write software. When they ask what I do for fun I reply, “Well, I write software.” They laugh and then say, “No, no. I mean what do you aside from that? Like, in your spare time… you know… for a hobby?” It’s at this point, after replying with “software” for a third time, that people glaze over, sip their beverage, and walk off. <a href="../assets/images/data_head_twitch.gif">Bunch of weirdos.</a></p>
<p>I started writing software at an absurdly young age and I’ve never found anything that quite matches it for excitement. It’s like a daily crossword or a sudoku for me. I love the feeling of coming up with solutions to problems and musing over them until I feel as though I’ve reached the pinnacle of what I can achieve with it.</p>
<p>My very first language was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC">GW-BASIC</a>. It was terrible. The painstaking agony of being required to change line numbers and <code>GOTO</code> points. Just awful, simply the worst. At around age 5 I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Compute-Compatibles-Basic-Programming-Collection/dp/0874550831">Compute!’s IBM &amp; Compatibles BASIC Program Collection</a> and punched in the code. It was fun watching things come to life… although often really frustrating having mistyped a single character and then needing to scour the entire chapter looking for my error. I didn’t understand most of it or how it worked, so I just tinkered around with things until I got interesting results. I created a few programs of my own, nothing more than trifles as they didn’t really amount to more than flashing text and system beeps. It wasn’t until I ran into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic</a> that I really began to enjoy and create programs that featured more complex ideas such as disk I/O and mouse input.</p>
<p>Most of my youth was spent writing DirectX and OpenGL games and game engines that would allow me to write games with fewer lines of code. These days I really don’t mind what I’m writing, so long as I’m writing. Now my repertoire includes far more languages, tools, and frameworks. I’ve begun listing them below for those interested.</p>
