My name is Ryan and I like programming. It's more likely an obsession if we're being honest. When people ask me what I do for a living I tell them that I write software. When they ask what I do for fun I tell them that I write software. Then they laugh and say, "No, no. I mean what do you aside from that? Like, in your spare time? You know... for a hobby?" After replying that I write software for a third time, they glaze over, sip their beverage, and walk off. Bunch of weirdos.

I started writing software at an absurdly young age and I've never found anything that quite matches it for excitement. I love the feeling of coming up with solutions to problems and musing over them until I feel as though I've reached the pinnacle of what I can achieve with it.

My very first language was [GW-BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC). It was terrible. The painstaking agony of being required to change line numbers and `GOTO` points. Just awful, simply the worst. At around age 5 I read [Compute!'s IBM & Compatibles BASIC Program Collection](https://www.amazon.com/Compute-Compatibles-Basic-Programming-Collection/dp/0874550831) and punched in the code. It was fun watching things come to life... although often really frustrating having mistyped a single character and then needing to scour the entire chapter looking for my error. I didn't understand most of it or how it worked, so I just tinkered around with things until I got interesting results. I created a few programs of my own, nothing more than trifles as they didn't really amount to more than flashing text and system beeps. It wasn't until I ran into [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) that I really began to enjoy and create programs that featured more complex ideas such as disk I/O and mouse input.

Most of my youth was spent writing DirectX and OpenGL games and game engines that would allow me to write games with fewer lines of code. These days I really don't mind what I'm writing, so long as I'm writing.
